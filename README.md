# Master Thesis: Type Class Coherence with Subtyping

In this work we aim to bring together three notions of polymorphism:
Subtyping as a form of ad hoc polymorphism, parametric polymorphism and ad-hoc polymorphism in the form  of type classes.
We do so by extending the research language [duo](https://github.com/duo-lang/duo-lang), which already supports algebraic subtyping, with type classes.
In order to ensure type class coherence we argue for a restrictive way of implementing instances for types that are in the subtyping relation.
