# Master Thesis: Type Class Coherence with Subtyping

In this work we aim to bring together three notions of polymorphism:
Subtyping, parametric polymorphism and ad-hoc polymorphism in the form  of type classes.
There are some interesing observations about how type class resolution is extended over the lattice of types.
In order to ensure type class coherence, essential for reasoning about type class overloading, we argue for a restrictive way of implementing instances for types that are in the subtyping relation.
