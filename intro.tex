In many programming languages type classes are a powerful tool to generalize functions over different data types.
Another approach to overloading functions is subtyping, i.e. if a value of a certain type is expected we can also supply a value of a more specific type that is subsumed by the general type.

Although these approaches do not serve the same purpose it is uncommon to find both concepts in the same language.
