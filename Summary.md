# Type Class Coherence with Subtyping

## Introduction

Introduce polymorphism concepts and advantages.
Outline challenges and advantages of adding type classes.

## Polymorphism

General idea and reasoning principles of forms of polymorphism.
Problem of coherence.

## Qualified Types

### Theory of Predicates

Calaculus for predicates on types

### Witnesses

The same calculus (+more)
Basis for reasoning about type class coherence

### Coherence

Discuss conditions for coherence based on witnesses

### Inclusive Subtyping

???

### Representations of Type Class Witnesses

Discuss both forms and argue for dictionary passing
(could be as well in the implementation section)

## Type System

### Type Annotations

Show what methods look like and motivate annotations

### Typing Rules

Usual typing rules, examples for typing methods and general typing rules for methods

### Type Inference

Brief or dense, depends on whether or not instances are passed as constraints or immediatly resolved (by having annotations)

## Implementation

What does a program with type classes in the mentioned language look like

### Example

Examples for class and instance declarations, and usage(!)

### Duo

Brief overview of duo and the same/similar example
